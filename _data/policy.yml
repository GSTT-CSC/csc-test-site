            into law, with requirements for companies to have a uk-based responsible person. UK MDR 2002 is applicable 
            to applications developed by the CSC as they will be deployed into clinical use. The software we build 
            includes AI applications that we intend to deploy on the AIDE platform, or as stand alone medical devices. 
            <br> <br> Although the CSC does not initially intend to put the software we create onto the UK market, we 
            still work within a quality management system that is ISO 13485:2016 compliant to ensure best practises 
            when developing SaMD."
