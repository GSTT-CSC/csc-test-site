### Fellowship Bio
Dr Adam Julius is an Anaesthetic Registrar
with a strong foundation in clinical care, technical
expertise, and leadership. He has implemented
tablet-based learning for medical students,
tackled VR-assisted regional anaesthesia projects
and delivered digital professional development
during COVID-19. 


### Fellowship Project
##### _High-dimensional modelling of the focally injured human brain_
##### University College Hospitals London NHS Foundation Trust

Adam has been working on various projects in
Professor Nachev’s group, honing his AI and ML
skills. His primary contribution this year has
been to NeuroNLP, an AI system that classifies
and labels neuroradiology reports. This generates
operational data and provides ground truth data
for advanced image classification and generation
algorithms.
He has been involved in testing, training, and
debugging NeuroNLP, creating 2D and 3D
embeddings of training data, and co-authoring
a paper set for submission soon. He’s also been
studying large language models and their potential
applications in healthcare.

### Fellowship Testimonial
My goal is to apply the
knowledge and skills I’ve gained to develop
data-driven ML-based solutions to clinical and
operational problems. My next step is a one-year
research fellowship in liver transplant anaesthesia,
where I will apply ML techniques to clinical risk
estimation and devise innovative preoperative
assessment approaches that enhance safety and
efficiency through ML and automation.
