### Fellowship Bio
Dr Adam Mayers is a Radiology
Registrar at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, with subspecialty interest
in oncological imaging and previous
experience in computer science.


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Automated extractionof dementia related volumetric assessments from radiology reports](assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster AdamMayers.pdf)_
#### South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust

The aim for the project was to develop a
natural language processing algorithm
that could perform automated extraction
of mentions of neurodegeneration-
relevant volumetric assessments from
plain text brain MRI reports, in a large
cohort of patients referred for imaging
from memory clinic in the South London
and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.
Adam developed a machine learning
algorithm to perform the above task.
He also gained further skills around
developing/maintaining datasets and
experimental design and hyperparameter
tuning.
The project was published as a poster at
the Dementia Platforms UK Translation
2023 Conference and is being prepared for publication.

### Fellowship Testimonial
During the fellowship
I gained generalised AI skills and
increased my experience in more
widely applicable data science software
development skills.
