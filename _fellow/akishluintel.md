### Fellowship Bio
Dr Akish Luintel is an infectious diseases
registrar and PhD student at the Institute of Global
Health Innovation. He has been interested in
digital health since helping launch EPIC at UCLH
in 2018/2019. This led to a national role where he
served as clinical lead for Risk Stratification, COVID
Oximetry@home, and Shielding at NHS Digital.
Currently, he is working with Professor James Teo at
Kingâ€™s College Hospital on using Cogstack and NLP
in infectious diseases.


### Fellowship Project
##### _Targeting penicillin allergy delabelling services using structured and unstructured data_
##### King's College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
6% of the UK population has a label of penicillin
allergy, but fewer than 5% of patients with
documented penicillin allergy have positive allergy
tests. This impacts on antimicrobial resistance,
length of stay, and costs. Electronic health record systems and AI could
improve this problem.
The project goals were to: engage stakeholders
to create a penicillin delabelling service; identify
inpatients with penicillin allergy; and use AI to help
risk stratify patients into low or high risk of severe
reaction, to target them for delabelling.
The project team engaged with the immunology/
allergy, pharmacy, and microbiology teams to create
an inpatient penicillin delabelling service and were
successful in getting buy-in for the project.

### Fellowship Testimonial
Being part of the fellowship has
allowed me to develop my understanding of the AI
landscape, the upcoming challenges as clinicians
and the regulatory challenges on the horizon.
