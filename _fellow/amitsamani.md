### Fellowship Bio
Dr Amit Samani is nearing
completion of training in medical
oncology and aims to combine a clinical
career with a role that recognizes the
potential for data, AI, and/or technology
to improve patient outcomes by
generating new treatments and
optimizing healthcare systems. He is
currently working on several projects
that involve real-world data and AI,
and he is committed to continuously
learning and broadening his horizons
in his consultant career.


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Technical evaluation of an AI solution for prostate cancer detection](/assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster AmitSamani.pdf)_
#### Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust
The goal of the project was to evaluate
the real-world performance of a
Siemens AI product designed to detect
prostate cancer on bi-parametric MRI
scans.
Through the project Amit had the
opportunity to learn the fundamentals
of study planning, design, execution
and statistical analysis relevant to
technical evaluation of a specific type of
AI product.

### Fellowship Testimonial
The fellowship
has given me a broad understanding
of the various facets of clinical AI
including regulation, governance,
clinical safety and challenges for
clinical implementation. Beyond this, I
have expanded my network, met some
wonderful fellows and am seeking
opportunities to take this forward.
