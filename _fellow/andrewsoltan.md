### Fellowship Bio
I split my week between clinical practice, as a specialty registrar in Medical Oncology, and as a Clinical AI Research Engineer at the University of Oxford’s Departments of Engineering Sciences and Oncology. I also lead the Dissertation Module for Oxford’s MSc in Applied Digital Health. My current research interests focus on building foundational models to improve cancer care, aiming to generate pilot data through early clinical translation. My previous research work included developing and evaluating an AI screening test for COVID-19 in emergency departments, using routinely collected blood tests and vital signs within one hour of patient arrival, and building a scalable platform for hospitals to participate in federated AI model development easily and cost-effectively.
 
### Fellowship Testimonial
The NHS Clinical AI Fellowship brought together an energetic national network of like-minded clinician-developers, and organised workshops featuring high-profile speakers at the forefront of some of the most cutting-edge research in the field. With regulatory and translational frameworks fast-developing during our cohort, the workshops were a fantastic opportunity to hear from stakeholders at key regulatory agencies and the emerging subnational UK health-data networks. The programme also provided access to resources for self-directed learning in technical areas and change management. The fellowship has a highly active alumni network which continues to circulate exciting opportunities and events.
