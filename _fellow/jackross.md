### Fellowship Bio
Dr Jack Ross is a registrar in clinical pharmacology
with a keen interest in digital health and medicines
safety. He had the opportunity to lead the AoMRC
report into AI in healthcare. Jack firmly believes that
AI has the potential to bring about significant benefits
to patient care. However, he also recognizes the
importance of ensuring its safety and effectiveness,
as with any medical intervention.


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Radiomic evaluation of non-small cell lung cancer](assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster JackRoss.pdf)_
#### Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust
The main aim of the project is to train and test
radiomic and machine learning models for analyzing
CT-PET scans of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer. The goal is to achieve more accurate risk
stratification for these patients.
Throughout the year, the project has evolved, relying
on the roll-out of FLIP and AIDE platforms. A more
autonomous pipeline has been developed, starting
from the automated segmentation of lung cancers
to detailed radiomic analysis and summary statistics.
The team is analyzing local data and comparing
the results to manual segmentations as well as
published data from other sites. The ultimate
objective is to replicate the findings on a federated
platform in a multi-site trial once the platforms are
fully operational.

### Fellowship Testimonial
A brilliant part of this year
has been the focus on self-development, working
with the other Fellows in Clinical AI, improving my
programming skills, and the lectures and seminars
with experts from industry and regulators. I want to
use AI to improve patient outcomes throughout
my career, and to build on this fellowship with the
network of clinical AI fellow alumni.
