### Fellowship Bio
James is an emergency physician and part of the
first cohort of Clinical AI Fellows. He has an interest
in leveraging data to aid clinical decision making and
risk stratification in emergency care.


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Novel predictive algorithm development for high-cost early mental health care](assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster JamesLai.pdf)_
#### South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust

The goal of the project was to develop a predictive
model for high intensity users in mental health care,
based on the first three months of data extracted from
an anonymised data pipeline.
Dr Lai developed an algorithm to predict high-
intensity users of mental health care using data held
in electronic health records (EHR) at the South London
and Maudsley NHS Trust. The aim was to develop a
working model to classify patients as predicted ‘high-
intensity' users at 12 months’ after initial assessment.
Dr Lai also worked with the team from
the Centre for Translational Informatics to extract
anonymised data from the Clinical Record Interactive
Search (CRIS) system within the NIHR Maudsley
Biomedical Research Centre

### Fellowship Testimonial
This fellowship has given me the
breadth of knowledge to become a member of the
Royal College of Emergency Medicine Best Practice
Committee, where I hope to develop guidance on the
adoption of AI and digital technologies in emergency
care.
I will also be starting a PhD involving Machine Learning with the Major Trauma
Service at Imperial College London and St Mary’s
Hospital.
