### Fellowship Bio
Dr Kavitha Vimalesvaran is a Cardiology Registrar
specialising in cardiac imaging and pursuing a PhD
at Imperial College London. Her research focuses
on developing AI-assisted clinical decision support
systems to improve the efficiency of cardiac MRI.
She works at the interface between data science and
clinical medicine in the UKRIâ€™s first cohort of AI in
Healthcare Doctoral Training Programme.


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Assess the clinical effectiveness in prioritising CT heads using AI (ACCEPT-AI)](assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster KavithaVimalesvaran.pdf)_
#### Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust
The primary goal of this national, multi-centre
randomised clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of
qER (an AI-based software for non-contrast head CTs)
on the report turnaround time of abnormal scans in
patients presenting to the emergency department.
Kavitha and her team recruited four sites across the
UK, developed a detailed study protocol, determined
the sample size, and established a robust data
management plan. They are in the process of
obtaining approvals and ethical clearances, as well as
planning a health economic analysis.

### Fellowship Testimonial
The fellowship provided me with
the opportunity to lead a multi-centre randomized
controlled trial, enhance my knowledge in clinical
AI implementation under the guidance of world
experts, and develop a versatile professional skill set
to tackle complex healthcare challenges. This has
improved my ability to contribute to the future of
healthcare delivery using the skills acquired during
this fellowship.
I gained valuable insight into the technical
challenges in implementing AI in healthcare
and managing expectations from different
stakeholders.
