### Fellowship Bio
I am a specialty trainee doctor in Urology.
During medical school, I taught myself programming and engaged in various healthcare projects developing digital tools throughout my training. 
I am passionate about leveraging digital technologies to enhance clinician experiences and improve patient outcomes.


### Fellowship Project
##### _[Implementation of artificial intelligence based autosegmentation to aid the contouring of clinical target volumes and organs at risk for patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy](assets/docs/posters/FCAI C2 Grad Poster LuisRibeiro_London.pdf)_
##### Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust

The project aimed to implement an AI-based program to assist clinicians in mapping organs on patient scans before radiotherapy, a task currently done manually to ensure precise targeting of cancerous tissues. As part of my role within the team, I evaluated the clinician time saved during the CT scan model rollout and curated data for the MRI-based model, which is set for future deployment. The team successfully launched the CT model clinically for use on patients and completed prospective outcome data collection. We also finished data curation for the MRI model and are now assessing its accuracy on retrospective scans.

### Fellowship Testimonial
This fellowship has created a solid foundation of knowledge and experience for me to grow my future career in this space. Whilst I have always kept a pulse on this landscape, the combination of expert cutting-edge lectures and practical hands-on experience I would have been unable to get anywhere else. Working through some of the challenges in my own project have given me an appreciation on how difficult it is to implement AI in a healthcare setting. By far the most enjoyable aspect was the discussions with the other fellows and faculty about opportunities and challenges within the space and their own projects.
