### Fellowship Bio
Dr Mustafa Khanbhai is an Oncoplastic Breast Surgery registrar at Barts Health. He completed a PhD at
the Centre for Health Policy within the Institute of
Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London, and is proud to be able to leverage his clinical,
academic and policy experience by taking innovative approaches to transform healthcare.
As a
Fellow in Clinical AI, he has been involved in developing clinical decision support systems to effectively triage breast cancer cases using various machine learning approaches. 


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Developing an AI based clinical decision support system for streamlining breast cancer multidisciplinary meetings through evidence integration](/assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster MustafaKhanbhai.pdf)_
#### Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust

The projectâ€™s goals were to develop a process map
for breast cancer care pathway at GSTT; integrate
breast cancer MDT data into Deontics with
local and national guidelines; carry out manual
validation of outputs compared to historic MDT
and develop decision trees; and apply machine
learners to determine variables for triage.
Mustafa and the team achieved most of the goals
as described above, with the added opportunity
to network with key stakeholders and appreciate
the power of integrating informatics and AI in
everyday healthcare delivery through regular AI
Centre driven cohort sessions.


### Fellowship Testimonial
I strongly believe that being
part of the fellowship has elevated my experience
and profile within the healthcare informatics
ecosystem and provided me with the opportunity
for further global work in clinical AI.
