### Fellowship Bio
I currently work as a doctor in the neuroradiology department at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, also part of the South East imaging academy, and the team that I collaborated with on this clinical AI project.


### Fellowship Project
##### _The impact of integrating an AI decision support tool into the stroke pathway of NHS Trust: a single centre study._
##### University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust

The goals of the project were to assess the following;  1. Is there a clinically significant difference between standalone radiology reporting and hybrid reporting with E-stroke for the patient population using our stroke pathways?   2. To assess the E-stroke's networking function and whether its use in the stroke pathway has a clinically significant health benefit difference for the local patient population (effect of networking function). 3. Provide recommendation on how trusts might continue the use of the stroke AI decision support tools within the broader context of medical AI programs in the Trust.  The learning objectives of this project were: Medical AI software validation and evaluation, IT integration, Systems impact, and Clinical workflow design. I took the lead in coordinating with medical AI tool vendors and stroke pathway stakeholders to secure authorization and gather pertinent data for analysis. I also regularly updated the clinical AI governance group and the specialist division on the project's progress and completed reports on clinical workflow design and systems impact, recommending to the relevant integrated healthcare networks how these newer health technologies might be used going forward.

### Fellowship Testimonial
This fellowship gave me a rare opportunity to put much of my previous skill set to use because I  worked on a similar project as part of my postgraduate studies. However, it also offered a wealth of possibilities to pick up new skills in a quickly evolving area of healthcare delivery. My scientific research approach and the way I manage and implement healthcare projects especially those involving newer health technologies have been greatly impacted by the experience I obtained from the fellowship.
