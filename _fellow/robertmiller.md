### Fellowship Bio
Dr Rob Miller graduated from Bristol University with
a medical and neuroscience degree. He completed his
foundation training in Thames Valley and subsequently
moved to London for surgical training. His dedication
to this work will persist as a Topol fellow, allowing him
to further advance the application of machine learning
in hand surgery.


### Fellowship Project
##### _Development & deployment of artificial intelligence radiology platforms_
##### King's College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
The project goals were to understand the theory,
development, implementation, and evaluation of
autonomous imaging AI in clinical radiology. This
focused on the use of machine learning techniques
through an active learning platform to train an intracranial haemorrhage segmentation model.
During the fellowship Rob contributed to the
development of an intra-cranial haemorrhage
segmentation model using the MONAI label platform.
In doing so, a model was created to facilitate
increased rate of intra-cranial haemorrhage CT head
images, which can be used to enhance training of
an intra-cranial haemorrhage phenotyping model.
Performance of the segmentation model was evaluated
against a novice clinician regarding accuracy and
speed of segmentations and usability of the MONAI
label system.

### Fellowship Testimonial
With a subspecialist interest in
hand surgery, I have been actively contributing to
developing machine learning models in this field
during my fellowship.
This fellowship allowed me to compile a successful
application to the Topol digital transformation
fellowship to develop a hand x-ray segmentation
model and continue work on autonomous hand
function analysis, which is aligned to my clinical sub-
specialist area of interest.
