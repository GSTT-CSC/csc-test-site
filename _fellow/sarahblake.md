### Fellowship Bio
Dr Sarah Blake is a cardiology registrar at St Thomasâ€™ Hospital, specialising in
congenital heart disease and cardiac
imaging. She completed her medical
training in Bristol in 2012 and obtained
a PhD from the University of Liverpool
in 2020. She is the Women in Cardiology
Representative for the BJCA.


### Fellowship Project
#### _[Artificial intelligence in chest X-ray interpretation](assets/docs/posters/FCAI C1 Grad Poster SarahBlake.pdf)_
#### East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
The goal of the project was to validate, deploy
and monitor a deep learning algorithm which generates automated reports for CXR and categorises the scan as
normal vs abnormal.
During the fellowship I gained knowledge
about how to select, validate and evaluate
AI algorithms for use in healthcare. I
learned how to integrate a new software
into existing trust IT. I developed a better
understanding of trust infrastructure and
how to implement change in the NHS. I
learned how to work with a commercial
partner.

### Fellowship Testimonial
The fellowship has
given me confidence to use and evaluate
AI software used in healthcare. This is
likely to be useful as a consultant where I
will have more responsibility and be better
able to improve systems in a hospital trust.
