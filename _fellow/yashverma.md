### Fellowship Bio
Plastic Surgery Registrar based in Cambridge. Passion for digital and clinical innovation, especially within the field of surgery. Hoping to deliver a smarter and more equitable healthcare across the NHS. 


### Fellowship Project
##### _[Optimising theatre efficiency for routine elective procedures](/assets/docs/posters/FCAI C2 Grad Poster YashVerma_EastOfEngland.pdf)_
##### Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

Project goals are to improve theatre efficiency for by routine predictable high volume elective procedures such as hip and knee replacements. Operating theatres are one of the most expensive resources in a hospital setting. Current practices in theatre use and scheduling are highly inefficient and outdated. Machine learning models can be employed to accurately predict the length of an operation individualised to the patient, surgeon, location, day and time to schedule cases more efficiently. 

### Fellowship Testimonial
It has been a very inspiring and educational year. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with and learning from my peers. The work being done by the pioneers in this field is truly inspirational and has opened my eyes to the endless possibilities and innovations in this space for healthcare delivery.
