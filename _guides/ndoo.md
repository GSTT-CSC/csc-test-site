title: National Data Opt-Out (NDOO)
shorthand: NDOO

The [National Data Opt Out (NDOO)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out) ensures that patients have a right to withdraw their consent to any of their data being used for research or service development, i.e. secondary/indirect care purposes. Therefore, if they do have a recorded opt-out status, their data must therefore be excluded.

Within Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT), the currently most straightforward way to check the opt-out statuses is to do so via the NDOO Check Service web application. This can only be accessed by staff with valid GSTT email addresses and whilst on the Trust VPN.

GSTT staff can either manually input one or more NHS numbers on the website itself, or they can submit a CSV file containing up to 100,000 NHS numbers per request. If they are unable to identify the NHS numbers of one or more patients within their cohort, the general recommendation from the Information Governance (IG) team is to exclude these patients.

Based on their submissions, GSTT staff will then receive a response file (to the email address provided in the original submission) containing the NHS numbers of patients who have not opted out and whose data may be included.

⚠️ Users of accessing the NDOO Check Service should not be maintaining a record of the patients who have opted out! The response file should only be used for the purpose of complying the NDOO policy and adhering to the data retention policy as outlined in the project's Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

We recommend users reach out to the IG team for their further advice if they believe there are:
- Project-specific patient opt-in processes that should take precedence over the NDOO policy.
- Patients who should still be included in their project despite not having identified their NHS numbers and therefore their NDOO opt-out statuses.
