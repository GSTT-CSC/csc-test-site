This guide describes how to book a room for CSC meetings, 10x workshops, etc., specifically for the following two main GSTT locations:

- **Tabard House** ([near Guy's Hospital](https://goo.gl/maps/oXe43wbJMX93rLi69))
- Education Centre (also referred to as **York Road**) ([near St Thomas' Hospital](https://goo.gl/maps/UcAy7bYhy8YNsNq88)) 

**⚠️ If you do not have access to either of the above locations, please email the [Security Access Authorisation](mailto:SecurityAccessAuthorisation@gstt.nhs.uk) team with your line manager copied to request this be granted.**

To book a room, you will need to provide the required:

- Date(s)
- Time slot(s)
- Seating capacity
- Technical setup e.g., monitor(s), if applicable

For **Tabard House**, the preferred room is the **Library** on the ground floor* and booking requests should be sent via email to the Medical Physics department's Assistant Service Manager.

For **York Road**, you can either book:

- The **Glass Meeting Pod** on the 10th Floor via a request emailed to the Executive Assistant (EA) to the Deputy Chief Executive's Office.
- Other rooms in the building, as well as other sites such as Minerva House and Great Dover Street, via the [MICAD room booking website](https://gstt.nhs.micadipr.net/pages/roomMonitoringClients/rmSignIN.asp?return=%2Fpages%2FroomMonitoringClients%2FrmRoomSearchForClients%2Easp%3F), which **must be accessed via the Trust VPN i.e., Citrix, if not on-site**.

\* _You will need an access code to enter this floor in Tabard House. If this has not already been provided, please email the [CSC Team](mailto:CSCTeam@gstt.nhs.uk)._

#### Visitors
If you have invited colleagues who do not usually have access to either location, you will need to collect them from the reception.
