On **bi-weekly Wednesdays**, the CSC Team hosts a 10x Workshop. Within this space, we discuss new topics surrounding the 
implementation of AI within the healthcare sector, we have group discussions about current practices, and we discuss new 
AI ideas and AI policies pertinent to the NHS.

The 10x Workshops are also an opportunity for CSC Team members to present their projects to the wider Team. We also 
invite external parties to share knowledge. If you are from an external organisation and you are interested in 
discussing your work at one of our 10x Workshops, please get in touch!

We also use the 10x Workshops to hold regular Retrospective exercises. These quarterly group exercises allow CSC Team 
members to raise and discuss positive experiences, as well as any difficulties, barriers or delays to working that they 
have experienced. We conclude these Retrospective sessions by creating actions focused on improving our working 
practices moving forward.

A list of previous and forthcoming 10x Workshops can be found on the CSC Team Sharepoint here:
