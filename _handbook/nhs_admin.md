All new members of the CSC team will complete a Trust Corporate Induction, including any upfront training required for their role and primary work site. Each member will be provided with a GSTT account and corresponding GSTT email address e.g., FirstName.LastName@gstt.nhs.uk. This will give you access to the Trust's intranet and services, including the Human Resources (HR) Portal, IT ServiceNow Portal (for IT support), and the College of Healthcare Learning Hub [(COHLH)](https://coh.gstt.nhs.uk/login/index.php) portal for completing mandatory training and educational courses.

**Admin portals**

New starters should ensure they register and have access to:

- [Electronic Staff Record (EST)](https://my.esr.nhs.uk/dashboard/web/esrweb) i.e., to access payslips, P60 forms, pension contributions, etc.
  - Click on "Unlock Account" to register for the first time.
- [HR Portal](https://fids.gstt.nhs.uk/adfs/ls/)** i.e., to raise and manage HR requests/transactions, access HR policies, etc.
- [IT Service Centre](https://gstt.service-now.com/ess/?id=my_requests)** i.e., to raise and manage IT requests/incidents, access the IT system catalogue, etc.
- [MICAD room booking system](https://gstt.nhs.micadipr.net/pages/roomMonitoringClients/rmSignIN.asp?return=%2Fpages%2FroomMonitoringClients%2FrmRoomSearchForClients%2Easp%3F)* i.e., to book meeting rooms across GSTT sites. More details about the process [here](guides.html#Room-Booking)


**Work expenses**

If you require a work travel budget to be authorised and paid for by the NHS, the first step is to email the CSC team lead for authorisation. 

Once it has been authorised, you will then need to book your travel arrangements with Clarity BT by either:

* Their booking system [Clarity Booking System](https://ctmcrown.sabscorp.com/js/clarity/current/#/logonl)
* Emailing their online support team at [gsttonline@claritybt.com](mailto:gsttonline@claritybt.com) or offline support team at [gstt@claritbt.com](mailto:gstt@claritbt.com) 
* Contacting their [online](mailto:gsttonline@claritybt.com) or [offline](mailto:gstt@claritbt.com) support teams by phoning +44 (0)333 230 9194

\* _Accessible only via the Trust VPN i.e., either on-site or whilst logged into Citrix (see below for how to set up this remote desktop and application access)_.

\** _The usernames used to logged into these websites are either your GSTT email address or GSTT username, and the password used will be the password you use to login to your email and desktop on-site_.


#### NHS staff policies
**Remote Working**

The CSC team generally work both remotely within the UK and on-site, with the proportion of time spent in each subject to the nature of work, individual member responsibilities, and Line Manager approval. Generally, in-person attendance at the fortnightly 10x workshops is required but team members may join remotely if necessary.

Remote working overseas, however, is not permitted by the Trust due various tax and legal requirements. 

**Annual Leave**

As per Trust policy, requests for annual leave, as well as other forms of leave, should be raised with your Line Manager for approval.

The annual leave balance is renewed in April, and there are certain periods within the UK fiscal year in which you can sell/buy annual leave (see HR Portal for more information) subject to approval. If you find you expect to have a remaining unused annual leave balance and do not wish to sell these days, carry over into the next fiscal year is typically approved if it is 5 days or less, whereas more than 5 days will require Line Manager approval. In either case, we recommend you speak to your Line Manager as soon as possible to request formal approval and discuss leave scheduling.

**Performance Development Review (PDR)**

Members of the CSC Team undergo a yearly Performance Development Review (PDR) with their Line Manager, as well as a follow-up mid-year review. This is an opportunity for members of the team to set personal development goals and objectives, reflect on their ongoing progress, and highlight any outstanding areas where additional training and/or support may be required. It is also an opportunity to discuss your career progression, health and well-being concerns or changes in working hours.

For more information on the PDR process, please refer to the Trust HR Portal.

#### Access GSTT IT platforms
**Remote desktop and applications i.e., via the Trust VPN on Citrix**

New starters should ensure they set up and can access their remote Trust desktop and applications.

1. Set up SafeNet Mobile Pass for One Time Passcodes (OTP) to use in conjunction with your GSTT account password
   - Submit the "Remote access request" form on the [IT Service Centre](https://gstt.service-now.com/ess/?id=my_requests) website and request that the setup guide be sent to you by IT once the ticket has been completed.
   - Download the SafeNet Mobile Pass application on an easily accessible device e.g., phone or tablet.
2. Set up Citrix either by:
   - Installing the Citrix Workspace app from [here](https://www.citrix.com/products/receiver.html) and connecting to GSTT's server i.e., https://connect.gstt.nhs.uk **(recommended)**
   - Bookmarking the Citrix login website [here](https://connect.gstt.nhs.uk/vpn/index.html)
      - This will require you to download the images of your remote desktop and/or application(s) to open them and you will need to manually delete these files from your Downloads folder. 
   
After completing the above steps, you should be able to access your GSTT applications remotely by logging onto Citrix with your GSTT username and password, and OTO generated on the SafeNet Mobile Pass application. If you require access to your GSTT desktop i.e., a single remote desktop window with multiple applications contained therein, and this has not been automatically enabled in your Citrix, please contact IT. 


**GSTT data platforms**

Depending on the projects you will be involved in, you may also need to request access for and familiarise yourselves with the following data platforms to collaborate with the rest of the project team. 

- **The Clinical Analytics team's enterprise data warehouse (EDW) (also referred to as _Health Catalyst_ or _HC_)**
  - Email the Head of the Clinical Analytics team to request for access to this SQL server data warehouse and provide:
    - The date of your most recent Information Governance (IG) training
    - Details on what type of data you require and why
    - Any IG and project approvals relevant to your project
- **CRIS***
  - Email the Head of CSC for request for access to the application and up-to-date guidance on who to directly contact, if applicable.
- **XNAT**
  - Email the CSC team's XNAT administrators to request for access to this [imaging informatics platform](https://xnat.org/) and training.

\* _To be updated post-Epic go live in October 2023_.

In terms of technical skills required to interact with these platform, there is often a Graphical User Interface (GUI) available but **some familiarity with Python and SQL is recommended**.
