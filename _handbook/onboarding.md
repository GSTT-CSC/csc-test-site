**Desk Area**

The CSC team is based at St Thomasâ€™ Hospital (part of GSTT), however we mostly work remotely 
via Microsoft Teams, using <a href="https://github.com/GSTT-CSC/">Github</a> and our website.
The CSC team mainly resides on the 10th Floor in the [Education Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J5BUnrPw1eHsNDdq8) (also referred to as **York Road**), but can also be granted access to:

- **Tabard House** ([near Guy's Hospital](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jDNeBb3Q21Bd7eUL8))
- The 5th ("Big Ben" side) and 9th floor (meeting rooms) in [**Becket House**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g3Rc6bPowryfpby16) 
  - For access, please email the Operations Assistant for the Biomedical Engineering department for the necessary forms, training, KCL card issuance, and guidance.

Access to these sites should be requested and approved by your line manager, and implemented so you can simply swipe your card at the entrance. 


While we have a flexible work schedule, team members should be available to meet during standard working hours, where 
required, such as for stakeholder meetings, CSC Standups and our 10x Workshops.


**Equipment provided**

New members of the CSC Team are provided with a brand new Apple MacBook Pro to perform their work. If additional 
equipment or software is required for your work, this can be arranged with the Head of the CSC Team.


**Meeting invites**

New starters should organise with the Head of CSC or CSC staff to be added to the following meetings, groups, and Microsoft Teams:

- KCL Microsoft Teams i.e., to access main CSC chat, MT-CSC OneDrive, KCL calendar, etc.
- GSTT Microsoft Teams i.e., to access secondary CSC chat, GSTT-shareable only files, GSTT calendar, etc.
- 10X Workshops meeting series (fortnightly in-person sessions 3 - 5:30PM, every other Wednesday)
- Bi-weekly stand-ups (9:30 - 10AM on Tuesdays and Thursdays)
- Quality Management System (QMS) audits (internal and external)
- Interesting project meetings
- Upcoming conferences

**Arrange 1-2-1's with all CSC Staff**

New starters will be expected to arrange 30-minute meetings with each staff member of the CSC, on Teams or in-person, for 
introductions as early familiarity with the team encourages a supportive working culture. The meetings should discuss:

- Career to date (new starter and current staff member)
- Length of new-starters time with the CSC

For trainees and elective staff, the meetings should also discuss:  
- Experiences you wish to gain with the CSC
- Competencies that could be completed

**Access to our GitHub**

The CSC team uses GitHub for code storage and version control for all applications built in-house, as well as the 
team's QMS. Each new staff member must create a GitHub account and get the Head of CSC to add them to the [GSTT-CSC GitHub organisation](https://github.com/GSTT-CSC). 

The new starter should search for issues with the "Good First Issue" tag to contribute to current projects and to become 
familiar with CSC software development process. You can read more about version control with git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

**Create "Team-Member" Website Profile**

All new staff and trainees must create a new page and profile on the ["Meet the Team" page](https://gstt-csc.github.io/team.html) on the website, along with a picture (250x250px) and any social media links e.g., GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. To do so, please refer to the README on the website's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/GSTT-CSC/gstt-csc.github.io).

**STP Trainee On-boarding Tasks**

In addition to all of the above, STP trainees must:

- **Create a blog posts** outlining an interesting project completed or 10X, and an account of the experience of their duration with the CSC Team, with feedback. Examples of blog posts created by STPs include:  
  - [Bioinformatics Trainee](blogs/articles/2021/08/25/STP_blog_Igor.html)
  - [Clinical Engineering Trainee](/blogs/articles/2022/07/01/STP_blog_Isabella.html)
- **Communicate *wanted* experience** (as opposed to *needed* experience) to separate out the trainees' interests from tasks required by the competencies and/or CSC workload.
- **Get assigned 1st and 2nd Supervisor**
- **Organise weekly check-in sessions with supervisors**
- **Confirm a schedule for completing projects, competencies, DOPS, OCE's, etc.**
