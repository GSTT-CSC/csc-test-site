The CSC Quality Management System has been developed in-house and applies to all standalone software medical devices developed by the Clinical Scientific Computing team at Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust.

The team are committed to complying with all applicable legal requirements in order to facilitate the translation of software medical devices from R&D into routine clinical care. This is balanced with a need to adopt modern processes of the internet-era to respond to peopleâ€™s raised expectations and the rise of data-driven technologies.

As developers of software medical devices that could have an impact on safety, we commit to minimising clinical risks in compliance with appropriate legal and professional standards to ensure we support safe and effective care. In order to facilitate this, we commit to a radically open and transparent development process that allows scrutiny from all stakeholders and encourages a culture of honesty, inclusiveness and collaboration.

In the spirit of continuous improvement, we will review this quality policy on an annual basis to ensure we continue to effectively communicate with everyone within our organisation the goal of the QMS as well as to ensure it is fit for purpose on top of the shifting landscape of digital health.

Processes and procedures relating to the Clinical Scientific Computing QMS are designed with a risk-based approach and are continually reviewed and improved as a result of GitHub issues, CAPAs, Internal and External Audits, and Management Reviews
