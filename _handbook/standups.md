The CSC Team hosts Standup meetings every **Tuesday and Thursday** from **9.30â€“10.00am**. 

The first part of the meeting is devoted to news pertinent to the entire CSC Team. The second part of the 
Standup is dedicated to individual members of the team summarising work from the previous days and detailing their plans
for the next few days. This is also an opportunity to appraise anything noteworthy or raise any concerns which 
might be a barrier to progress.
