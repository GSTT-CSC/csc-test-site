**Our mission**

The CSC mission statement is: developing people, platforms and policy for digital health. Our objectives are to
develop the NHS digital workforce of tomorrow, to create and support innovative new software and to advise on
policy relating to software as a medical device.

**Our values**

The CSC team values reflect the values of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Our values are at the heart of 
everything we do. They are to:

* Put patients first
* Take pride in what we do
* Respect others
* Strive to be the best
* Act with integrity

**Our purpose**

The CSC Team supports clinical teams within GSTT to evaluate or develop AI which addresses a clinical need or clinical 
pathway. We can support projects of varying sizes and at various stages of the project lifecycle. Typically, we will be
engaged in projects for their entire lifecycle and a CSC member would be assigned to individual projects(as the CSC 
Lead) to provide a single point of contact clinical leads on the project.

**Team organisation**

The CSC Team is small group of individuals from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from radiology and nuclear medicine to data science and genomics. The team is made up of 7 full time members and 3 part-time members. The team is part of the Medical Physics department within the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals NHS Trust.
