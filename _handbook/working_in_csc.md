The CSC Team is small group of individuals from a variety of backgrounds. The team is made up of 7 full time members 
and 3 part-time members. We are based at St Thomasâ€™ Hospital (part of GSTT), however we mostly work remotely 
via Microsoft Teams, using GitHub and our CSC website.

New members of the CSC Team are provided with a brand new Apple MacBook Pro to perform their work. If additional 
equipment or software is required for your work, this can be arranged with the Head of the CSC Team.

While we have a flexible work schedule, team members should be available to meet during standard working hours, where 
required, such as for stakeholder meetings, CSC Standups and our 10x Workshops.

The CSC Team supports clinical teams within GSTT to evaluate or develop AI which addresses a clinical need or clinical 
pathway. We can support projects of varying sizes and at various stages of the project lifecycle. Typically, we will be
engaged in projects for their entire lifecycle and a CSC member would be assigned to individual projects(as the CSC 
Lead) to provide a single point of contact clinical leads on the project

The general purpose CSC Team email address is [cscteam@gstt.nhs.uk](mailto:cscteam@gstt.nhs.uk).
