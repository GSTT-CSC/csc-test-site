Recognising that knowledge and learning are driving forces behind innovation and progress, the team actively invests in fostering education within the NHS, and having a future ready work force.

Education is pivotal in empowering individuals to adapt to emerging challenges, drive technological advancements, and enhance patient outcomes. It promotes fairness by ensuring equal access to learning opportunities, enhances transparency through informed decision-making, and strengthens accountability by embedding a culture of ethical responsibility.
