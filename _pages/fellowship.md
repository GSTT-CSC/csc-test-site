The Fellowship in Clinical AI is a year-long programme which is integrated part-time alongside clinical work.
This unique programme is featured in the [NHS Long Term Workforce Plan](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan/) as an exemplar of upskilling staff to maximise the transformational benefit of AI technologies in the NHS.

Our fellows are smart and energetic individuals who will lead the charge to revolutionise clinical workflows with AI.
Fellows are recruited competitively from various clinical workforce groups across participating regions of the NHS, including doctors, dentists, nurses & midwives, AHPs, and pharmacy professionals.

<h3 style>Background to the Fellowship</h3>

Clinical leaders with expertise in Artificial Intelligence are essential to the integration and rollout of AI software in NHS trusts. 
To fully deliver the UK government's goal of being a [global AI superpower](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/614db4d1e90e077a2cbdf3c4/National_AI_Strategy_-_PDF_version.pdf), the NHS must provide dedicated training for clinicians in cutting-edge skills required for clinical AI deployment.
This fellowship is the first systematic route in the UK to acquire the relevant skills in clinical AI deployment. Fellows  gain expertise in clinical AI alongside their existing roles and implement state-of-the-art AI software in live hospital environments.

Fellows are matched with an expert AI supervisor to gain experience in real-world applications of clinical AI. Fellows gain skills and knowledge relevant to the full life cycle of healthcare AI from a bespoke programme of teaching aligned with the Clinical AI Curriculum developed by the faculty.
As a lasting legacy of the fellowship, fellows become part of a uniquely networked community of interest within the healthcare AI community.
