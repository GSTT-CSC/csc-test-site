The NHS Fellowship in Clinical AI is a 12-month programme which is integrated part-time alongside clinical work.

Fellows are recruited competitively from 7 participating regions across the NHS, drawn from a diverse clinical workforce including: medical and dental specialty trainees, nurses & midwives, allied health professionals, and pharmacy professionals.
Our fellows are smart and energetic individuals who will be equipped to adopt clinical artificial intelligence technology.
Fellows gain experience deploying AI in clinical workflows in 12-month project placements, under expert supervision in multidisciplinary teams.

This unique programme is featured in the [NHS Long Term Workforce Plan](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan/) as an exemplar of upskilling staff to maximise the transformational benefit of AI technologies in the NHS.
