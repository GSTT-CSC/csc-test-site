<h3 style>Introduction</h3>
The NHS Fellowship in Clinical AI is a 12-month programme which is integrated part-time alongside clinical work.

Fellows are recruited competitively from 7 participating regions across the NHS, drawn from a diverse clinical workforce including: medical and dental specialty trainees, nurses & midwives, allied health professionals, and pharmacy professionals.
Our fellows are smart and energetic individuals who will be equipped to adopt clinical artificial intelligence technology.
Fellows gain experience deploying AI in clinical workflows in 12-month project placements, under expert supervision in multidisciplinary teams.

This unique programme is featured as an exemplar in upskilling clinicians for AI transformation in both the *[NHS Long Term Workforce Plan (2023)](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nhs-long-term-workforce-plan-v1.2.pdf#page=74)* and the NHS Transformation Directorate report, *[Developing Healthcare Workers' Confidence in AI (2022)](https://digital-transformation.hee.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/digital-transformation/dart-ed/developingconfidenceinai-oct2022.pdf#page=68)*. 
The fellowship builds directly from the recommendation of the *[Topol Review (2019)](https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/HEE-Topol-Review-2019.pdf#page=8)* to create posts for clinicians with dedicated time to implement AI technologies.
