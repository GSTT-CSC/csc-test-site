title: About the Fellowship in Clinical AI
---

About the programme: 

Clinicians with expertise in Artificial Intelligence are essential to the integration and rollout of AI software in NHS trusts. To fully deliver the UK government's goal of being a global AI superpower, the NHS must provide dedicated training for clinicians in cutting-edge skills required for clinical AI deployment. 

I’m so proud of what you’re doing. I look forward to following your career paths because you’re going to light it up. You’re going to be the change agents for medicine, and we sure need it. 

Professor Eric Topol, Founder and Director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, Leader of The Topol Review 

This fellowship is the first systematic route in the UK to acquire the relevant skills in clinical AI deployment. Fellows will gain expertise in Clinical Artificial Intelligence (AI) alongside their existing roles and implement ground-breaking work in the use of state-of-the-art AI software in live hospital environments.    

Fellows are matched with an expert supervisor in their region to gain experience in real-world applications of clinical AI. Fellows will gain skills and knowledge relevant to the full life cycle of healthcare AI from a bespoke programme of teaching aligned with the Clinical AI Curriculum developed by the faculty.     

Alongside gaining knowledge relevant to the full life cycle of healthcare AI, fellows become part of a unique Alumina of special interest experts and develop their soft skills, expand their networks and engage in various opportunities within the AI in Healthcare community.
