Our team hosts fellows from the [Fellowships in Clinical Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/fellowships). 
This ground-breaking programme is the first of its kind in the UK. It was created to bring expertise in clinical artificial intelligence to the NHS frontline.

In this programme, the fellows are embedded part-time for 1 year in a clinical AI team at a [partner hospital of The London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/our-partners). They  directly develop, deploy, and evaluate clinical AI models under the supervision of experts in the field. Fellows  gain further skills and knowledge from a programme of teaching aligned with the Clinical AI Curriculum. 

Our team members were instrumental in the development of the fellowship and curriculum: 
- [Dr Alexander T Deng](/team_member/alex.html) is the Programme Lead
- [Haris Shuaib](/team_member/haris.html) is the Director.

For up to date information on the recruitment and content of the fellowships, please visit the [information page](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/fellowships).
