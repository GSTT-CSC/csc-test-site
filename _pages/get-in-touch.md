If you would like to reach out to us please submit the form below with further details and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

Please note that we only support electives from trainees on the Science Training Programme who wish to spend their elective with us. We 
do not have capacity to support medical electives, and can currently only support volunteer work with us if you are already a GSTT employee 
as obtaining honorary contracts is a lengthy process and most of our work requires permission to work with medical data. 


For the Fellowship in Clinical AI, please [email](mailto:gstt.aifellowship@nhs.net) instead.
