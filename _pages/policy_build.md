</div>

The CSC Team develops software applications for routine clinical usage. This includes Software as a 
Medical Device (SaMD). The development of medical software requires extra safety considerations above 
normal software development, particularly around clinical and patient safety, data security, usability, and managing changes.  

The CSC Team provides both software and clinical expertise across a broad range of hospital settings. We are embedded 
within Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, which gives us direct access to clinical databases including PACS, 
CRIS and EPR.

## The Software Building Process

<h3 style="color: #D7472E">The CSC Quality Management System</h3>

The CSC team develops medical software within a quality management system (QMS) that is ISO 13485:2016 compliant. The 
scope of our QMS is for the development of medical software application that are deployed within the Trust. 

We have gained ISO13485:2016 certification for our QMS from the UK Certification body [Scarlet](https://www.ukas.com/wp-content/uploads/schedule_uploads/1001534/23422Management-Systems.pdf) in 2022. 
<br>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="assets/img/policy/scarlet_accredited_logo_dark.png" width="30%"/></div>
<br>
The QMS sits within the GSTT Medical Physics Department and utilises key departmental processes and resources for audits, 
management review, HR, and purchasing. It incorporates all aspects of the standards and regulations listed on the page 
below, as relevant to the scope. 

The following software and languages have been validated for use for projects under this QMS:
  - XNAT
  - MONAI
  - MLOps

See our blog series on our journey to building a certified Quality Management System (_in progress_).
