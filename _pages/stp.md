title: Scientist Training Programme (STP) Scheme
permalink: /stp.html
description:

The NHS employs Clinical Scientists who work in scientific roles within hospitals. The NHS Scientist Training Programme 
(STP) is a three-year [scheme](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/) of work-based learning, supported by a 
University accredited master's degree, which trains graduates to become registered Clinical Scientists.

The CSC team now offers a new STP specialism in [Clinical Scientific Computing](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/informatics/clinical-scientific-computing/). 

Trainees will be based at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) working within the CSC team. Trainees will 
learn about the use and development of AI in healthcare, including the ethical use of clinical data, to improve patient care and outcomes.

Beyond GSTT, the CSC team is also a core member of the [London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/). 
This allows STP trainees to learn in a globally unique environment by not only giving them access to the 
[world’s largest supercomputer dedicated to healthcare](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/news-and-events/news/helping-build-uks-most-powerful-supercomputer-ai-healthcare), but also being an integral part of the entire AI product lifecycle from research and development, to procurement and post-market analysis.

Trainees who specialise in Clinical Scientific Computing will gain a variety of skills including: 
- Knowledge of all stages of the Software Development Lifecycle
- AI skills
- Programming skills
- Creating software
- Commissioning software for clinical use
- Maintenance of clinical software
- Data curation
- Project management
- Software policy expertise

## How to apply

For more information on how to apply, please refer to the 
[National School of Healthcare Science (NSHS)](http://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/) Applicants page 
[here](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/applicants/). Typically, the process consists of three stages:

- Longlisting based on the results of a situational judgement test
- Shortlisting by scientists' review of applications
- Online interviews by employers

As applicants are only able to apply for one specialty, you will need to refer to the [STP Specialisms](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/applicants/stp-specialisms/) 
available each year. Typically, those interested in working with our team should apply for those within the 
**[Physical Sciences](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/physical-sciences/)** 
and **[Informatics](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/informatics/)** 
themes, specifically **[Clinical Scientific Computing](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/healthcare-science/healthcare-science-specialisms-explained/informatics/clinical-scientific-computing/)**.

## Trainers

The STP [Trainers](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/trainers/) section of the NSHCS website is kept up to date 
with new information and resources.
 
We’ve covered all of the essentials on working with the 2022 curriculum, this includes:  
changes to [rotations](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/trainers/guidance-for-working-with-the-2022-stp-curricula/rotation-modules/) which now provide trainees with an understanding of their specialty and the wider healthcare environment around them, 
- planning and [scheduling training](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/trainers/guidance-for-working-with-the-2022-stp-curricula/scheduling-training/) through the phases of the curriculum,  
- the [work-based curriculum](https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/programmes/stp/trainers/guidance-for-working-with-the-2022-stp-curricula/the-work-based-curriculum/) including the updated competencies and considerations, work-based assessments and clinical experiences  
- changes to the core modules including the new [Professional Foundations](https://curriculumlibrary.nshcs.org.uk/stp/module/S-C1/) and [Independent Professional Development](https://curriculumlibrary.nshcs.org.uk/stp/module/S-C4/) modules. We’d suggest starting to look at both of these modules with trainees as they start, there’s lots to consider as they begin to develop their professional skills and knowledge. 
 
This information is also available as 30-minute recorded webinars which focus on:  
- introducing the 2023 curriculum  
- the updated competencies and work-based assessments  
- covering the changes to rotations 
- the new core modules in more depth 
 
The curriculum and in particular the rotations now have a greater emphasis on reflective practice. We discuss reflective practice in the context of IACC which will also support you preparing for rotations and we’ll be providing more resources designed to support the rotations soon.

### Our commitment to STP training

We STP trainers and supervisors completed the STP programme ourselves, so we're acutely aware of it challenges. 
We're committed to continuously improving the experience for each new STP trainee. We will: 

- Confirm the trainee's STP requirements at the start of the rotation/placement.
- Assign useful CSC tasks; no fake work for the sake of an exercise.
- Undertake additional [Educator training](https://portal.e-lfh.org.uk/myElearning/Index?HierarchyId=0_54104_54116&programmeId=54104)
- Identify the experiences trainees **_need_**, and things they _**want**_ - _we map projects to ensure both are achieved._
- Have weekly 1-2-1 check-ins with each trainee.
- Review trainee work in an agile method, rather than a waterfall, to encourage trainees to show working and pick up issues and misunderstandings early. 
- Map competencies to a timeline with flexible deadlines.
