AIDE is an open-source tool which allows healthcare providers to deploy AI models safely, effectively, and efficiently by enabling the integration of AI models into clinical workflows.  

This comprehensive system encompasses administrative and clinical tasks, as well as regulatory compliance, and is in development with [MONAI Deploy](https://monai.io/), an international working group led by [King's College London (KCL) and the AI Centre's Industry Partner, NVIDIA](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/news-and-events/news/new-monai-tool-eases-development-ai-assisted-annotation-models).

The first instance of AIDE went live at King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (KCH) in September 2021, with a [stroke AI tool](https://www.aicentre.co.uk/news-and-events/news/aide-go-live) as one of its first models deployed to support clinicians in improving direct patient care.

AIDE will be rolled out to nine further Trusts by 2023.
