[CogStack](https://cogstack.org/) is an application framework which allows users to extract information from unstructured data sources, such as electronic healthcare records (EHR), where the majority of the important information is stored across multiple formats of unstructured data. Unstructured data formats include binary word documents, PDFs, images, free text fields, etc. and prevent meaningful clinical information from being programmatically queryable. 

Therefore, once extracted, harmonised and processed, multiple uses of this unstructured data become possible based around information retrieval and extraction via CogStack. Use cases include Natural Language Processing (NLP) (for example, [MedCAT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01165)), enterprise search, alerting, cohort selection and research.
