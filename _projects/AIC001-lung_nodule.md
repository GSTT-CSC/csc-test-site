summary: Automatic lung nodule detection and characterisation on CT Chest
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Anil.html">Anil</a>
modality: Low-dose CT
pathology: Lung nodule growth, lung cancer
rationale: The identification and characterisation of lung nodules for lung cancer indication is a repetitive and time-consuming process, and the burden of small team specialist thoracic radiologists. AI software that performs as well as a thoracic radiologist could provide initial assessment on all low-dose chest CT’s with incidental lung nodule pick-ups.
patient-pathway: In virtual clinics, Thoracic Radiologists and Physicians discuss patients with incidental nodules picked up on CT's done for other reasons. Preparation for these meeting is time consuming. 
training-data: 200 patients – found on PACS retrospectively using the patients from Lung nodule clinics. All patients for lung nodule follow-up are imaged with a standard low dose chest CT protocol.
errors: Patients do not receive follow up for lung cancer, leading to worse outcomes for patients, more complex treatment, higher costs of treatment. Patients receive needless imaging and investigations. Incorrect volume assessment leads to misdiagnosis of lung nodules. Pipeline failure could result in delayed/missed diagnoses. 
goals: An automated computer aided diagnostic tool integrated with the low-dose chest CT protocol which accurately detects and characterises Lung nodules and reports the patient for further investigation, resulting in a more streamlined workflow that is efficient at screening for lung cancer.
success-criteria: Non-inferiority to trained thoracic radiologist for lung nodule detection. Reduction in radiologist workload.

Despite there being no current national screening program for lung cancer in the UK, some areas in England offer Lung 
Health Checks targeting the high-risk populations. Screening is achieved through low-dose chest CT but requires a 
trained thoracic radiologist to accurately detect and characterise lung nodules; a process that is repetitive and time 
consuming. Lung nodules can be hard to identify, and a volumetric assessment is required for lung cancer indication.

General radiologists assessing a patients’ chest LDCT performed for other reasons may lack the impetus/training to 
detect lung nodules, potentially missing diagnoses. An AI software that could pre-read and report lung nodules means 
general radiologists could produce nodule management plans not dissimilar to that reported by a thoracic radiologist, 
therefore improving confidence in cancer work, and reducing the burden on thoracic radiologists.
