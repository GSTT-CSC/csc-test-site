title: Osteoporosis
status: Contracting
image: /assets/img/projects/Osteoporosis.jpg
summary: Timely identification of vertebral compression fractures to promote early treatment interventions.
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Dika.html">Dika</a>
modality: CT first, then x-ray, then MRI.
pathology: Vertebral compression fractures (spine)
rationale: 77% of scans with vertebral compression fractures are correctly identified and 43% scans recommend referrals â€“ both of these numbers can be improved with AI tool.
patient-pathway: Incidental findings, patients present for imaging for other reasons
training-data: Clinical datasets are available (CT, MRI, x-rays). Imaging usually performed for other indications.
errors: A timely identification of vertebral compression fractures which indicate osteoporosis allows the clinicians to refer the patient for osteoporosis treatment. If the osteoporosis signs are missed and the patient sustains a fracture, the fracture is complex and carries a high rate of mortality in older patients
goals: Increased rates of identification and treatment referrals after identification to reduce occurrence of complex fractures in other sites.
success-criteria: Increased referrals and identifications of vertebral compression fractures
alternatives: <a href="https://www.zebra-med.com/bone-health-solution"> NanoxAI</a>. Retrospective and prospective trials are planned to take place in the early 2022. The results will determine whether this clinical problem will be solved with NanoxAI's BoneHealth solution

Osteoporosis is easily treatable if identified, but can lead to complex fractures at other sites if undiagnosed, especially in the hip where a > 50% mortality at 12 months over the age of 80. Currently, 70% of vertebral compression fractures are undiagnosed though they are the most common osteoporotic fracture. This project would work in conjunction with the current fracture liaison service quality improvement project.

**Project Plan**<br> <strike>1.	Meeting of all persons involved to determine AI specifications.</strike> <br><br> 2.	Agreeing on technical specifications, success criteria and evaluation plan. <br> <br> 3. Dataset curation (retrospective) -- approximately 1000 CTs with spine in field of view, patients > 55 years. Cogstack to be used for cohort selection. <br><br> 4.	Retrospective evaluation (3 weeks, 1000 scans)<br><br>5.	Prospective evaluation live in clinic (2 months) <br><br>6.	Analysis of evaluation results: if successful, then procurement, if unsuccessful, change strategy. After the completion of CTs, we will move on to solve the same problems using other modalities. <br><br>7. Audit
