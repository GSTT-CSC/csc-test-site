title: Prosthetic Loosening
status: Data Curating

summary: An AI tool to improve accuracy and increase confidence in reporting of prosthetic loosening.
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Dika.html">Dika</a>
modality: SPECT/CT
pathology: Prosthetic loosening – mostly hip and knees, occasional elbow and shoulder.
rationale: Prosthetic loosening is definitively diagnosed with a SPECT/CT. Around 40% of cases are not obvious and in 20% of cases the report is changed with further consultation. An AI tool would help in accuracy and increase confidence in reporting.
patient-pathway: Patients are referred as a result of:<br><br>1 – pain in the replacement site<br>2 – x-ray investigations suggest loosening<br><br>Patients are referred from orthopaedics and surgery to consider replacement of a prosthesis or to revise the replacement. Next steps are decided by SPECT/CT reports. SPECT/CT is also used for surveillance so imaging is repeated in intervals.
training-data: 250 patients annually. Data to be gathered retrospectively.
errors: When the diagnosis of prosthetic loosening is missed, the patient remains in chronic (severe) pain for a prolonged amount of time. When the diagnosis of prosthetic loosening is incorrect, patient undergoes unnecessary surgery.
goals: Reducing patient pain and avoiding unnecessary surgery. Improving diagnosis speed and accuracy.
success-criteria: Increased diagnostic accuracy and thus reduction in unnecessary surgery, increase in speed with which loosening is diagnosed.
alternatives: Currently no commercial products identified

Bone scan and SPECT CT are effective ways of assessing loosening as the metal artefact reduces the clarity of other imaging modalities. Patients will also be referred to x-ray and CT, but SPECT/CT supersedes these for accuracy.
