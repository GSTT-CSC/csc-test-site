<b>Introduction</b><br>
Osteoporosis is easily treatable if identified, but can lead to complex fractures at other sites if undiagnosed, especially in the hip where mortality is over 50% at 12 months over the age of 80. Currently, 70% of vertebral compression fractures are undiagnosed although they are the most common osteoporotic fracture. This project would work in conjunction with the current fracture liaison service quality improvement project.<br>

<b>Rationale</b><br> Among patients with vertebral compression fractures, 77% of scans are accurately identified, and 43% recommend referrals. Both of these metrics could be improved with the use of AI tools. A timely identification of vertebral compression fractures which indicate osteoporosis allows the clinicians to refer the patient for osteoporosis treatment.<br>

<b>Training data</b><br> Clinical datasets are available (CT, MRI, x-rays). Imaging usually performed for other indications with incidental findings of vertebral compression fractures.<br>

<b>Goals</b><br> Increased rates of identification and treatment referrals after identification to reduce occurrence of complex fractures in other sites.<br>
