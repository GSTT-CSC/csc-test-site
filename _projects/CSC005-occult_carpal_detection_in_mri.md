title: MRI Occult Carpal Detection
status: Developing
image: /assets/img/projects/MRI wrist.jpg
summary: AI application to interpret MRI scans to increase sensitivity and confidence of diagnosis.
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Laurence.html">Laurence</a>
modality: MRI
pathology: Occult carpal fracture
rationale: Scaphoid and occult carpal fractures can be difficult to identify in MR images, typically requiring specialist radiologists that are not always available. This project aims to develop an AI application that can automatically identify these fractures.
patient-pathway: Patients with suspected scaphoid or occult carpal fracture are given an x-ray in A&E, if practitioner cannot identify a fracture patient is referred for MRI.
training-data: <b> Needs Revison- Not using TOHETI Data set now ? patients who attended A&E with suspected scaphoid fracture (n=67) have an MRI as well as an x-ray <b>
errors: Needless referrals to fracture clinic and needless immobilisation in patients who do not have a fracture; possibility of repeated x-rays and referrals to MRI
goals: An automated computer aided diagnosis tool triggered when appropriate MRI data are received able to streamline the workflow and enable faster reads of scans.
success-criteria: Improvement in diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic speed.
alternatives: Currently no commercial products identified

Scaphoid and Occult carpal fractures are a significant economic burden on society and the TOHETI study demonstrated economic advantages of primary scanning with short sequence MRI. We aim to develop an AI application to interpret MRI to increase sensitivity and confidence of diagnosis. This should enable rapid turnaround treatment and discharge of these patients, many of whom are treated unnecessarily. If applied this is likely to benefit communities where there are fewer radiologists available for image interpretation and allow triage of reporting.
