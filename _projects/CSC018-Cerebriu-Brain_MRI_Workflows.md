title: Smart brain MRI protocols 
status: Governance

summary: Evaluation of brain MRI smart protocoling software
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Laurence.html">Laurence</a>
modality: MRI
pathology: Neurology
rationale: A consequence of the ever-increasing demand for diagnostic MR imaging is additional workload and stress placed on MRI departments. MRI deparements need to operate as efficiently as possible. A smart protocoling application for brain MRI data has the potential to improve the efficiency of the clinical MRI service and improve patient prioritisation. This application may also reduce scan time, re-examinations rates and non-acute admission to ward environments.
patient-pathway: Patients who present to their GP with diffuse neurological symptoms (headaches, dizziness) are referred to GSTT for brain MRI. In current clinical practice, a radiologist will review these images and if an infarct is spotted, the radiologist must re-call the patient for additional MRI scans. Instead, with a smart protocol in place, the infarct can be flagged in real-time for the attention of the radiologist and additional follow-up scans can be completed in the same appointment slot.   
training-data: A commercial product is being evaluated
errors: 
goals: Retrospective measure of diagnostic accuracy. Prospective evaluation of performance and value added. Record correlation between existing pathway and Cerebriu recommended protocols.
success-criteria: Real-time adaptation of MR scanning protocols for the right sequences at the right time.
