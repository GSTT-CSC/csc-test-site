title: Evaluation of Chest X-Ray AI Engine
status: Data Curating

summary: An evaluation of an AI Engine that identifies 10 common chest radiograph pathologies 
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Laurence.html">Laurence</a>
modality: Chest X-Rays
pathology: Chest X-Ray findings including, effusion, fibrosis, consolidation, atelectasis and pneumothorax 
rationale: In the NHS there is a severe shortage of radiologists, in 2020 1 in 10 NHS consultant posts were unfilled and this is thought to continue to rise. In contrast, the NHS workload is increasing, in 2021-2021 39.9 million images were performed and Chest radiographs (CXR or Chest X-ray) are the most commonly requested imaging study. CXR often go unreported for days, or are never reported. This has the potential to lead to missed or delayed diagnoses, and often means CXR reporting is performed by non-radiologists in the acute setting. A large proportion of CXR are normal, meaning already-stretched radiology departments must make time to analyse data that will not lead to a change in management or diagnosis. AI has the potential to ameliorate some of these challenges through improving accuracy and efficiency of CXR reporting   
patient-pathway: Patients are referred to radiology for a Chest X-Ray. The X-rays are then reviewed by a radiologists and who reports on any findings, however CXR often go unreported for days, or are never reported. This delay in reporting or not being reported can mean delays in starting treatments or receiving a medical intervention.
errors: Incorrect pathology detected, requires further investigations by clinical team and time delay to starting appropriate treatments or medical intervention. 
goals: To improve reporting times for CXR when used as a second reader. To enable triaging through identification of different emergent and critical pathologies, and thus enable faster reporting of non-normal CXR. This technology may also have support training of junior radiologists by identifying pathology for CXR training sets.
success-criteria: •	Improving time-to-report for ‘urgent’ and ‘critical’ findings using criticality triaging
alternatives: N/A

**Project Plan**<br> <strike>1.	Meeting of all persons involved to determine AI specifications. <br><br> 2. Agreeing on technical specifications, success criteria and evaluation plan. <br> <br></strike> 3. Dataset curation (retrospective) and installation of software to CSC Sandbox Environment. <br><br> 4.	Retrospective evaluation (~4 weeks)<br><br>5.	Prospective evaluation live in clinic  <br><br>6.	Analysis of evaluation results: if successful, then procurement, if unsuccessful, change strategy. <br><br>7. Audit
