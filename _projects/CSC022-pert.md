title: Pulmonary Embolism Response Team AI  
status: Contracting

summary: AI enabled detection and classification of high risk PE patients
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Anil.html">Anil Mistry</a>
modality: CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA)
pathology: Pulmonary Embolism
rationale: Both patients arriving at GSTT, and in patients, with suspected High risk PE will alert the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team to allow multi-disciplinary decisions made for management, triage and treatment. Reduction in time to alert PERT of high-risk PE can result in reduced length of stay, morbidity and the improved outcomes from MDT decisions.    
patient-pathway: 
training-data: Retrospective data for evaluating a commercial product 
errors:  N/A
goals: Automated classification of high and intermediate-high risk PE patients by accurately calculating Right Heart Strain (RV/LV ratios) from CTPAs. 
success-criteria: Improvement in diagnostic accuracy and speed. Increased identification of intermediate risk patients alerting the PERT.

<br>
<br> **Rationale:**
The Pulmonary Embolism Response Team (PERT) comprises Interventional Radiologists, Haematology consultants, 
Cardio-thoracic surgeons, and Respiratory consultants,  
<br>
Both patients arriving at GSTT, and in patients, with suspected High risk or intermediate-high risk PE will alert the 
PERT to allow multi-disciplinary decisions to be made for management, triage and treatment.
Reduction in the time to alert PERT of high-risk PE can result in reduced length of stay, morbidity and improved 
patient outcomes from MDT decisions.
<br>
<br>
Triggering PERT, if the patient is not high risk, may benefit intermediate-high risk patients, however the speed of 
results to assign that risk category to a patient could cause delays in triggering that alert. An AI application is being 
evaluated to automatically pull CTPA images and calculate the  Right Ventricular/Left Ventricular (RV/LV) ratio as a 
good indicator of right heart strain, to risk stratify patients above certain threshold as appropriate to alert
the PERT, therefore speeding up the CTPA reporting and subsequent PERT engagement towards better patient outcomes.
