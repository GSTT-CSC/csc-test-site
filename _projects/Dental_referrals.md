summary: AI enabled detection and classification of high risk PE patients
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/Anil.html">Anil Mistry</a>
modality: CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA)
pathology: Pulmonary Embolism
rationale: Both patients arriving at GSTT, and in patients, with suspected High risk PE will alert the Pulmonary Embolism Response Team to allow multi-disciplinary decisions made for management, triage and treatment. Reduction in time to alert PERT of high-risk PE can result in reduced length of stay, morbidity and the improved outcomes from MDT decisions.    
patient-pathway: 
training-data: Retrospective data for evaluating a commercial product 
errors:  N/A
goals: Automated classification of high and intermediate-high risk PE patients by accurately calculating Right Heart Strain (RV/LV ratios) from CTPAs. 
success-criteria: Improvement in diagnostic accuracy and speed. Increased identification of intermediate risk patients alerting the PERT.
