title: Radiotherapy Auto Segmentation
#status: Evaluating
status: Current
image: /assets/img/projects/autosegct_logo.png
summary: Single application for all in-house auto-segmentation contours
csc-lead: <a href="/team_member/anil.html">Anil Mistry</a> and <a href="/team_member/tom.html">Tom Roberts</a>
modality: Radiotherapy planning CT 
pathology: Cancer
rationale: Contouring organs on CT's scans for radiotherapy treatments is vital for patient safety, however is very time consuming for Oncologists. AI models have been developed locally to automate the CT image segmentation. 
patient-pathway: 
training-data: Gold standard dual-labelled CT's and structure sets of patients treated historically at Guy's Cancer Centre. 
errors:  N/A
goals:  Provide an application that can clinically deploy all locally developed nnUNEt segmentation models successfully into the radiotherapy treatment planning pathway. 
success-criteria: Reduction in time spent contour by Radiation oncologists. Improves consistency in contouring OAR's. Increased accuracy of OAR contours.

<br> **Rationale:**

AI auto-contouring tools have improved dramatically in the last few years, and all major treatment planning system vendors are investing in this technology along with independent start-ups and NHS Trusts [NICE, 2023].

GSTT is in a strong position to develop an in-house auto-contouring pipeline using the AI expertise within Radiotherapy physics, clinical oncology, and the CSC team, strong links with King’s College London (KCL) academics and outputs from three KCL PhD students creating AI auto-contouring models.

Segmentation models have been created as output of the extensive research activity generated from Guy's Cancer Centre. This application will integrate the following models for evaluation in routine clinical care.


1. **Pelvis Model** - _Christopher Thomas_ 
* Rectum, Sigmoid, Bowel, Bladder


2. **Prostate Model** - _Maram Alquarni_ 
* Prostate, Rectum, Penile Bulb, Bladder, Femoral Head Left, Femoral Head Right 


3.  **BowelSpace  model** - _Christopher Thomas_  
* Bowel space             


4.  **Head&Neck Model** -  _Tom Young_    
* TBC


**TotalSegmentator**

In addition, the open source CT segmentation model Totalsegmentator(v2) provides 117 structures which could be clinically useful. The TotalSegmentator structures will be include in the generated structure for clinical evaluation on a site by site basis.

**nnUNet**

Each segmentation model is developed using the nnUNet semantic segmentation method:
