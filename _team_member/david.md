### Bio

David's background is in clinical engineering in device risk management and connectivity, first at Bristol University Hospitals and most recently at King's College Hospital, with a brief interlude in UEC commissioning in between.
David's interest in scientific computing has developed through his work maintaining the medical device asset registers at both Trusts and through his involvement in the rollout of the new electronic patient record at King's.

### CSC Team Role
David joined the team in 2024 as an [STP](/stp.html) trainee and is looking forward to learning about how they assess, deploy and manage new AI tools in the NHS, together with the supporting infrastructure they have built that allows them to do so at scale, responsibly, and for the benefit of patients foremost.
