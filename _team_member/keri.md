### Bio
Keri joined the CSC team as a Trainee Clinical Scientist in September 2024 after completing her PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Glasgow. Her research focused on developing machine learning solutions that could predict neuropathic pain development after spinal cord injury using neuroimaging-based biomarkers.

### CSC Team Role
Keri hopes that working within the CSC team will help her develop existing skills, whilst gaining hands-on experience with a variety of informatics systems and deploying AI models. She looks forward to understanding how the team improves patient and clinical outcomes within the NHS, all while working towards registration as a clinical scientist.
