### Bio
Tom joined CSC in October 2021 after more than 10 years working in academia as an MRI physicist. His Ph.D. was focused 
on the development of novel MR techniques for imaging the cardiovascular system. 

Tom joined King's College London in 
2017 where he specialised developing new methods for imaging the unborn fetus inside the womb. In particular, his work 
focussed on creating three-dimensional representations of the fetal brain and beating fetal heart for the purposes 
of improving the diagnosis of congenital birth abnormalities. 

Throughout his career, Tom has been driven to apply his technical skills to improve healthcare. In 2022, he gained an 
HEE Topol Digital Fellowship to deliver 3D fetal MRI capabilities to hospital Trusts outside of GSTT. 

### CSC Team Role
