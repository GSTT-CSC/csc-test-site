and virtual services.

### CSC Team Role 
As the Team AI Project manager I support the projects from beginning to end. My role is to facilitate each project 
though our pathway, from refining the projects ideas and goals, the completion of governance documents and the 
evaluation plan when the solution is deployed into the clinical setting.

##### When I grew up I wanted to be...
_...a part-time hairdresser and then a long distance runner for the Team GB at the Olympics!_
<br>
##### If I was a superhero, I would be...
_Wonder Woman! Well, that's what a BuzzFeed quiz told me, and who am I to question the results of a BuzzFeed Quiz?!_
<br>
##### A word of wisdom
_According to an old adage: "It's tough at the top". Well, I haven't got there yet, and I'm not even sure where the top 
is, but I'm enjoying the climb!_
